# Project Development Journal

## 8/06: Environment Setup
- **Action Taken:** Installed Python 3.12, Microsoft C++ Runtime, and required libraries. Created project directory, initialized `main.py`, and verified baseline execution.

## 8/07: IDE & Version Control
- **Action Taken:** Downloaded VS Code and configured the workspace for deep learning development. Created a GitHub repository (`biomechanics-project`) to track progress and version-control code updates.

## 8/08: Model Pipeline Integration, Evaluation & Completion
- **Action Taken:** - Integrated modular backend components (`data_loader.py`, `biomechanics_utils.py`) into a unified workflow.
  - Executed sliding window kinematic segmentation, generating 648 windows from multivariate joint angle arrays.
  - Trained and optimized an unsupervised Multi-Channel Autoencoder utilizing GPU acceleration (CUDA).
  - Calculated real-time reconstruction Mean Squared Error (MSE) to generate quantitative anomaly and fatigue scores.
  - Developed an automated early warning flag system to isolate the precise window index where form breakdown occurs.
  - Exported analytical data (`fatigue_results.csv`) and generated visualization artifacts (`comparative_cross-run_plot.png`).
